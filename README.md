# CST8132 Assignment #3 - Bank Account Reconciliation Program
This was my third assignment I created in my "Object-Oriented Programming" course at Algonquin College. Written in Java, the program reconciles a person's bank account (keeps track of each transaction against the bank account). It allows debits (withdrawals) and credits (deposits) and a category and date for each transaction (max 1000). The program starts with $100 in the bank account. Since each transaction has a category, the user can see a list of all categories and see a list of all transactions for a specific category. The program also allows the user to save what they have entered through serialization with ObjectOutputStreams.

This program greatly built on my knowledge of programming, making use of multiple classes with polymorphism and inheritance (the DebitTransaction and CreditTransaction classes inherit from the Transaction class), implementing an interface (most of the classes implement Serializable), try and catch blocks for input validation, and saving and loading data with ObjectInputStreams and ObjectOutputStreams.
